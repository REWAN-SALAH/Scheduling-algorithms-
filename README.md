Round Robin and Shortest Job First

# Round Robin Algorithm 
the implementation 
<a href = "https://github.com/REWAN-SALAH/Scheduling-algorithms-/blob/main/src/RoundRobin.java">RoundRobin  </a>


  A round-robin scheduling algorithm is used to schedule the process fairly for each job a time slot or quantum and the interrupting the job if it is not completed by then the job come after the other job which is arrived in the quantum time that makes these scheduling fairly.

  
Round-robin is a variant of first come, first served scheduling
No priority, special importance is given to any process or task
RR scheduling is also known as Time slicing scheduling

# Shortest Job First
<a href = "https://github.com/REWAN-SALAH/Scheduling-algorithms-/blob/main/src/ShortestJobFirst.java">Shortest Job First  </a>


Shortest job first (SJF) is a scheduling policy that selects for execution the waiting process with the smallest execution time. SJF is a non-preemptive algorithm.  Shortest job first is advantageous because of its simplicity and because it minimizes the average amount of time each process has to wait until its execution is complete. However, it has the potential for process starvation for processes which will require a long time to complete if short processes are continually added.
