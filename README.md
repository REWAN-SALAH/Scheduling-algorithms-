# Round Robin Algorithm 
the implementation 
<a href = "https://github.com/REWAN-SALAH/Scheduling-algorithms-/blob/main/src/RoundRobin.java">RoundRobin<\a>


  A round-robin scheduling algorithm is used to schedule the process fairly for each job a time slot or quantum and the interrupting the job if it is not completed by then the job come after the other job which is arrived in the quantum time that makes these scheduling fairly.

  
Round-robin is a variant of first come, first served scheduling
No priority, special importance is given to any process or task
RR scheduling is also known as Time slicing scheduling
